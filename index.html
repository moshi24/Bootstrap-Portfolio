  <h3>About me</h3>
  
    <p><img id="imgDog" src="../Bootstrap-Portfolio/images/download.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded float-left" alt="Doggie"> A Colombian who happens to have an asian face decided to join the unknown. A scary but interesting place where people come together and share their ideas and thoughts into a machine. This guy was overwhelmed by the amount of codes he has to learn from day one, but never gives up. He moved to the USA to find a better career path, and so He went to study in SFSU. When he finally graduated, he decided to seek for the America Dream. </p>
    <p>This guy is <strong>KAWAH</strong>. if you decide to take the risk and talk to him, you might go nuts! Please be advised, you can grab lunch with him anytime you want, but remember to pay. San Francisco is his favorite city because it has the most perfect weather and the nicest people.Just remember when you run over him, just say Hi! </p>
